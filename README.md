1. Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. Navigate to `src/CLI` folder
3. Open file `appsettings.json`
4. Change items below and fill in your user credentials
   * tidepool:Username = your tidepool username
   * tidepool:Password = your tidepool password
   * nightscout:BaseUrl = your NightScout url
   * nightscout:ApiKey = your NightScout API KEY
   * sync:since = since when the data should be imported (optional, can be null)

 ### Example configuration
 ```json
 {
"tidepool:Username": "tidepool@username.com",
"tidepool:Password": "password",
"nightscout:BaseUrl": "https://skalich.herokuapp.com",
"nightscout:ApiKey": "123456789101112",
"sync:since": "2020-07-01",
"sync:till": null
}
```
1. Open command prompt in the folder and run the app using `dotnet run`
2. You should now see your data in NightScout

## Run using only CMD
Good for AdHoc syncing.

1. Navigate to `src/CLI` folder
2. Run command `dotnet run -- tidepool:Username="tidepool@username.com" tidepool:Password="password" nightscout:BaseUrl="https://skalich.herokuapp.com" nightscout:ApiKey="123456789101112" sync:since="2020-07-31"`
   * This will sync all date since 31st of July 2020
   * It will also use Tidepool username, password and NightScout base url, API Secret from the command

## Sync values from Today

1. Navigate to `src/CLI` folder
2. Run command `dotnet run -- tidepool:Username="tidepool@username.com" tidepool:Password="password" nightscout:BaseUrl="https://skalich.herokuapp.com" nightscout:ApiKey="123456789101112"`
   * This will sync all data from Today
   * Notice that **sync:since** parameter is missing

## Sync values from any date
If you have filled your user credentials in `appsettings.json` you don't have to mention them when running the app using CMD.
